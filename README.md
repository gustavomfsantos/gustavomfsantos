Hi there! üëã I'm Gustavo Santos!

I'm a Data Scientist with over 3 years of experience in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights using both supervised and unsupervised ML techniques. My proficiency extends to Cloud and Databricks for ML End to End projects.

Here I showcase some of my personal projects

### [Nixtla Hierarchical Forecasting](https://github.com/gustavomfsantos/hierarchical_forecast.git) :airplane:
Nixtla is a Python package that introduces a novel approach to time series forecasting called Hierarchical Forecasting. This approach involves predicting time series at multiple aggregation levels and subsequently reconciling these forecasts to generate accurate predictions at higher levels. This project is a first try at the package with Real World Data, using Brazilian Tourism Oficial Data.
  - Hierarchical Forecasting: Predict time series at various aggregation levels.
  - Reconciliation: Merge forecasts at different levels to achieve a coherent and accurate prediction for the entire time series.

### [Sales Forecasting and Reconciliation Project](https://github.com/gustavomfsantos/Template_Time_Series.git) :arrow_down_small: :arrow_up_small:
This project focuses on sales forecasting and reconciliation, utilizing a combination of forecasting algorithms at different aggregation levels. The lower level employs DeepAR, the middle level uses LGBM, and the top level leverages Exponential Smoothing. Forecast reconciliation is performed using the Nixtla package. The Nixtla Package limits the algorithms options so this project works on bring different ML models into the forecast levels.
  - Data Exploration: Analyze the sales time series dataset to gain insights.
  - Data Preparation: Perform necessary preprocessing and transformations for model training.
  - Hierarchical Forecasting: Utilize DeepAR, LGBM, and Exponential Smoothing at different aggregation levels.
  - Forecast Reconciliation: Combine forecasts using the Nixtla package to obtain a coherent prediction.

### [Global Milk Price ( Whole Milk Powder - Global Dairy Trade) prediction Using PyCaret](https://github.com/gustavomfsantos/Global_Milk_Price.git) üêÑ ü•õ
This project aims to predict biweekly global milk prices using machine learning techniques. The project covers the entire data science pipeline, including data scraping, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation of results.
  - The data for this project is collected from reputable sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), GDT official website and agricultural market databases. The data includes historical biweekly milk prices along with relevant features such as production volume, weather data, and economic indicators.
  - The collected data undergoes thorough preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Features are scaled or normalized as required, and categorical variables are encoded appropriately. Additionally, feature engineering techniques may be applied to extract relevant information from raw data.
  - Various machine learning algorithms are explored for building the prediction model. Techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting are considered. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance. Additionally, ensemble methods may be employed to improve prediction accuracy.
